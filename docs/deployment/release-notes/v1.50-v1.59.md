# Release notes

## Version 1.58

### Clickhouse migration

In current release we moved from standalone Clickhouse container to the Clickhouse cluster that will be controlled by Altinity clickhouse operator.  
We automated process of transferring data from the standalone version to the cluster version of clickhouse, migration will be executed during upgrade process.

Things that you have keep in mind before upgrading process:

- Migration time depends on resources(mostly on CPU and Disk IO) allocated for Clickhouse instances, during our tests we've mentioned average speed 50Gb per hour for instances with 4CPU/16Gb RAM
- It's necessary **not to set** flags as `--wait` and `--timeout` during upgrading process because of migration time  
- Optional: We've developed a tool that checks consistency of data, you could use it before and after the upgrading process and compare results of those checks just to be sure that everything went as expected
    - Description of using `clickhouse-helper sanity`:
      TODO

## Version 1.57

### Helm configuration changes

- Removed the link to the database for the service `func-file`. If you have it in your `values.yaml`, then you can safely remove the `spring` map completely.

```yaml
funcFile:
  configurationFiles:
    "application.yaml":
      spring:
        datasource:
          # -- Mysql jdbc URL
          url: "jdbc:mysql://..."
```

- For the Clickhouse `busybox` image, the ability to set the repository and version has been added.

```yaml
clickhouse:
  busyboxImage:
    # -- Image registry
    registry: docker.io
    # -- Image repository
    repository: busybox
    # -- Image tag
    tag: 1.36.1
```

## Version 1.56

### Export metrics to Genestack

Fluent-bit was introduced as an extra service tasked with collecting and dispatching metrics in Prometheus format to a Genestack.

These metrics encompass technical and/or product-related data, devoid of any sensitive information.

If you wish to deactivate this functionality, you can do so by configuring the following parameter:

```yaml
fluent-bit:
  enabled: false
```

### Helm configuration changes

Now organization name and hostname are in a `global` section:

From:

```yaml
odmFrontendHostname: odm.local
applications:
  configurationFiles:
    "application.yaml":
      frontend:
        ui:
          organization:
            name: "Genestack"
```

To:

```yaml
global:
  hostname: odm.local
  organizationName: "Genestack"
```

## Version 1.55

### Configure ODM usage together with encrypted S3 bucket (SSE-KMS and SSE-S3 only)

#### Introduction

!!! attention ""
    You can find configuration examples in the ODM Helm chart.

In case you have several AWS credentials in your configuration, you need to modify only the credentials for
accessing the bucket in specified as `frontend.aws.bucket`.

#### SSE-KMS

To enable uploading into an SSE-KMS encrypted bucket, you need to customize `func-file` configuration.
The following configuration example uses a bucket encrypted by SSE-KMS with the name `<BUCKET_NAME>`.
The bucket configuration should specify the algorithm `aws:kms` as `preferredAlgorithm`. Additionally,
the property `kmsCmkId` should be added with a value equal to key id `arn:aws:kms:...` if the bucket policy
requires this key to be explicitly send on PUT request. The `func-file` section in the configuration
should look like this:

#### SSE-S3

The SSE-S3 encryption type is default to the most buckets. To force ODM request
this type of encryption from S3 provider for `<BUCKET_NAME>`, you need to specify
the `preferredAlgorithm` property with the value `AES256`:

#### On `storage_config` section configuration in `func-file`

Keep in mind that `func-file` reads the `storage_config` section sequentially. You can create specific configurations
for individual buckets, e.g., if one has SSE-KMS encryption while others do not. To do this, as the first item in
the list, you'll need to specify the bucket with the specific configuration and its name. Then, provide the general
configuration for the other buckets using the wildcard symbol `*`. ODM will only upload files to the bucket, specified
as `frontend.aws.bucket` property, regardless to `storage_config` section.

### Genestack pod separation

Example on the image section, but it's applicable for sections with backend/frontend separation.

ApplicationSettings changes showed separately:

From:

```yaml
genestack:
  image:
    backend:
      registry: 091468197733.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
      repository: genestack/core
      pullPolicy: Always
      pullSecrets: []
    frontend:
      registry: 091468197733.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
      repository: genestack/applications
      pullPolicy: Always
      pullSecrets: []
```

To:

```yaml
core:
  image:
    registry: 091468197733.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
    repository: genestack/core
    pullPolicy: Always
    pullSecrets: []

applications:
  image:
    registry: 091468197733.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
    repository: genestack/applications
    pullPolicy: Always
    pullSecrets: []
```
