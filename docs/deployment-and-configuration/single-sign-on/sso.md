# About SSO in ODM

For authentication, ODM supports the OpenID and SAML.

For user and group synchronization, it supports the SCIM.

!!! attention "Important information"

    - ODM can work with only one protocol (OpenID or SAML) at a time.

    - With OpenID, you can use OAuth tokens to connect to the ODM API ([documentation for Azure](./openid/azure.md#configure-oauth-resource-server))
