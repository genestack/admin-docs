### Genestack audit logs migration from MySQL to Clickhouse

This release migrates MySQL `genestack_audit` schema to ClickHouse `audit.Event` table and
removes `genestack_audit` schema from MySQL upon successful completion. Migration component responsible for it
is planned for a removal in the next release. As a result, this ODM version cannot be skipped during upgrades.
