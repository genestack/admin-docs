### Genestack audit logs migration from MySQL to Clickhouse

This release migrates MySQL `genestack_audit` schema to ClickHouse `audit.Event` table and
removes `genestack_audit` schema from MySQL upon successful completion. Migration component responsible for it
is planned for a removal in the next release. As a result, this ODM version cannot be skipped during upgrades.

### Excluding audit events from tracking

It is now possible to exclude specific audit events from tracking if they are not needed, which saves disk space.
For example, you can exclude events related to data reads.

A configuration example is available in the `examples` directory of the Helm chart.
